# Introduction

Hello, my name is Joonas. Final year software engineering student at Metropolia. <br>
<br>
Doing full stack development with TypeScript and React. I have experience with designing and creating great looking and user friendly front ends using React and libraries such as Tailwind. I have created back ends with frameworks such as Express and NextJS that have included REST APIs to connect both sides of my projects together. <br>
<br>
Additionally I also know Java, Python, Docker, SQL, database design and how to deploy completed full stack applications. <br>
<br>

## Here are some of my past projects

#### Android app made with Java.

User data gets saved to a PostgreSQL database trough [Trainer-API](https://github.com/ollivarila/Trainer-API). 
The app includes premade workouts for the user to choose from. Users also have the ability to create their own workout plans and share them with others.
Progress can be tracked with graphs which are created from past workouts.
